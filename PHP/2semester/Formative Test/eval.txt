WSERS 2 Formative evaluation

Story

You are given the startup SQL code for a promotional campaign. 
It creates two tables for people accessing the promotion and the promotions themselves. 

Create a login form for the website.
The user should ONLY type a username and click on login. 
If this is a first-time login, your user must be created in the PPL table, with his given username 
and the Money field equal to 0. 
If this is NOT a first-time login, you should read the Money field corresponding to the given username.

When logged in, the login form must disappear, and the following should be presented:
-	A welcome message stating how much money does the user have in his account. 
-	One form asking for a “promotional code”. 
-	One logout form (one button)


A logged in user, can type a promotional code and if that “KeyWord” exists in the promotions table 
your PHP code should:
-	Check if the field Available in the “Promotions” table is not 0 and if its 0 – tell the user 
                "You just missed our promotion”. 

-	When this field (Available) is not 0, decrease it by 1 and credit your user’s account with the 
“Amount” from the Promotions table.

When a logged in user clicks on logout, you should SAVE the amount that the user has gathered 
through promotions into the PPL table, in the Money field corresponding to his username. 
As well the entire session must be destroyed, and the process can restart 
(with the login button being presented again). 




Detailed instructions: (YOU CAN SKIP THESE if you know what you must do)
-	Create one startup HTML file (containing an html template)
-	Rename this file to “YourName.php” where you replace YourName with your actual name.
-	Create one html POST form with one input for a username and a submit/login button.


-	In the beginning of your page, start a PHP session and create a MySql database connection. 
-	Check if an index named “UserLoggedIn” in the SESSION array exists and if it does not, create it by assigning it a false value.
-	Check if the user has pressed on the Login button and if he/she did:
    o	Set the session of UserLoggedIn to be true.
    o	Store in the session under “CurrentUser” index the name that the user has typed for username.
    o	Search in the ppl table for a user with the given username (select and check the number of returned rows)
    o	IF this number of rows is 0:
        	Create a new entry into the PPL table with the given username and Money equal to 0.
    o	If you found already an existing person with the given username:
        	Read the Money column and store it into a Money index in the SESSION array.
-	Check in the session if the user is logged in (using the “UserLoggedIn” index):
    o	If this is true:
        	Write a welcome message and display the amount of money the user has (using the “Money” index from the session)
        	Create a form with an input (promoCode) and a submit button.
        	Create another form with just one single button – Logout.
        	When the user submitted a promoCode:
            •	Check if this code exists in the PromoTable and if it does:
                o	Check if the “Available” field for the accessed promotion is 0 and if is – display message “You just missed our promotion”.
                o	If the “Available” field is NOT 0, decrease it by one and increase the “Money” in the session with the obtained “Amount” from the promoTable.
            •	If the code does NOT exist in the promo table: display message “This is NOT a valid promotional code.”
        	When the Logout button is pressed:
            •	Update the Money field from the database for the “CurrentUser” to be equal with what you have stored under “Money” index in the session.
            •	Destroy the session.
            •	Reload the page.
    o	If this is NOT true (the user is NOT logged in):
        	Cut and paste the POST form that you have created in the beginning here.
